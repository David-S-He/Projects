## [Gun Violence Analysis and Predictions](https://github.com/David-S-He/Projects/tree/master/Understanding%20Gun%20Violence%20with%20EDA%20and%20ML)
The subject of gun violence has captured national attention for the past few years. In order to dig deeper and get a better understanding of this issue, we formed a small team of 4 and decided to conduct an independent analysis with the dataset provided by Kaggle and Gun Violence Archive.

This project aims to explore the relationship between certain features (related to gun violence, demographics, socioeconomic factors, NRA ratings, etc), number of incidents, number of casualties, and likelihood of mass events.

## [Perception and Consumption of Tap/Bottled Water](https://github.com/David-S-He/Projects/tree/master/Consumption%20of%20Tap%20and%20Bottled%20Water)
As a team, we designed an experiment to test whether providing a population baseline education on the benefits of tap water to could change consumption behavior. The experiment utilized concepts such as hypothesis testing, spillover effects, randomized assignments, heterogeneous and difference-in-difference treatment effects.

## [Prosper Loan Data Analysis](https://github.com/David-S-He/Projects/tree/master/EDA%20on%20Prosper%20P2P%20Lending%20Data)
I was curious about how different attributes of potential borrowers or lenders can affect the yield of loans.
