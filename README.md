## [Prosper Loan Data Analysis](https://github.com/David-S-He/Projects/tree/master/EDA%20on%20Prosper%20P2P%20Lending%20Data)
I was curious about how different attributes of potential borrowers or lenders can affect the yield of loans. 




## [Gun Violence Analysis and Predictions](https://github.com/David-S-He/Projects/tree/master/Understanding%20Gun%20Violence%20with%20EDA%20and%20ML)
The subject of gun violence has captured national attention for the past few years. In order to dig deeper and get a better understanding of this issue, we decided to conduct an independent analysis with the dataset provided by Kaggle and Gun Violence Archive.  
Our final project aims to explore the relationship between certain features (related to gun violence, demographics, socioeconomic factors, NRA ratings, etc), number of incidents, number of casualties, and likelihood of mass events.
